# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 

These scripts are assignments of the course named “Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization” which I studied on Coursera.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs.


# Introduction

These assignments cover the following topics:
 - GAN components;
 - Build basic GANs using PyTorch and advanced DCGANs;
 - Control GAN and build conditional GAN;
 - Compare generative models;
 - Use FID method to assess GAN fidelity and diversity;
 - Detect bias in GAN;
 - Implement StyleGAN techniques.

# Getting Started

The scripts are generated by using Jupyter Notebook. As the big size of each `ipynb` file, the files may not be loaded successfully on the browser. You can open the scripts by two methods:
 - Clone the repository and open the scripts by your local Jupyter Notebook.
 - Or open [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to enter the link of `ipynb` file.
